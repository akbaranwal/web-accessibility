WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.976
this James bird and
I'm here to talk

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.667
about web accessibility
so you can think

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.976
of the web a lot like
you can think of a

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.976
public library

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.976
it's a giant store
of information

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.976
available to everyone
that people from

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.976
all over can go to
however do you see a

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.976
problem in this image
if you can't get

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.976
upstairs you're
probably gonna have a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.976
little bit of trouble
getting into the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.976
library unless you
have an access ramp

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.400
where the accessibility
is basically

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.976
building access ramps
to the web and

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.976
making sure that
everyone can access

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.976
everything in the web
equally and on the

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.400
same level so here's
an example this

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.976
code more or less
you know looks fine

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.533
you know it's not
great code it's kind

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.976
of a crappy website probably but

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.976
nonetheless it works
however there are

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.976
some problems that
are not immediately

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.976
apparent from just
looking at the code

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.400
so here I'm going
to open up the web

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.533
page and we'll see
the problem see not

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.976
only is this ugly
there's also the fact

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.976
that if you have red
gooey red green

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.976
colorblindness you're
probably going to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.976
have a lot of trouble
reading any of the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.467
actual text because
it's green on red

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.976
this is probably not immediately

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.976
apparent to most
people and it doesn't

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.976
even affect most
people but it's still

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.976
there and you want
your website to be

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.976
accessed to be able
to be accessed by

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.533
every person you know
every person who

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.976
can't access your
website because of a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.976
disability is lost
business in addition

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.533
to just being unfair
to that person so

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.200
to combat this the
World Wide Web

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.976
Consortium which is
more or less the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.976
governing body of the
web or as close as

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.933
can be to one created the web

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.667
accessibility initiative
which sought to

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.976
create web content accessibility

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.533
guidelines or WCAG
currently they have

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.467
published wcag 2.0
in 2008 and that's

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.976
pretty much the why
most widely accepted

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.667
standard for web
accessibility standards

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.976
pretty much every
country goes by some

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.533
variant of this or
just uses WCAG 2 so

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.667
what does that consist
of well there are

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.600
four main principles
information should

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.976
be perceivable which
basically means

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.667
that everyone should
be able to perceive

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.976
the information you
shouldn't have any

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.976
information that's hidden to a

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.933
particular class of users for

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.067
if you are deaf you should have

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.976
transcripts that you
can read for audio

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.976
podcasts because otherwise that

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.976
information will be
completely hidden

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.600
information and the
website needs to be

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.976
operable which means
you need to be able

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.600
to access all of the
website regardless

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.976
of disabilities so
for example you

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.976
wouldn't want for
example a button that

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.976
can only be activated
by clicking on it

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.976
and not by any sort
of keyboard commands

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.976
because then if you
can't use a mouse do

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.976
it for example a motor
disability you're

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.976
not going to be
able to access that

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.600
button you have
understandable this one

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.976
is a little bit more
vague a little bit

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.267
more straightforward
basically all

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.976
information needs
to be able to be

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.976
understood by the
user your website

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.976
should be predictable
it shouldn't do

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.976
just like weird like
unexplained things

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.976
this is also just
good website design

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.976
besides being helpful
to some people

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.976
with disabilities and
then lastly your

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.976
website needs to
be a robust which

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.976
basically just
means you know for

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.976
unpredictable use
cases for things you

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.976
haven't tested you
know for different

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.333
weird specs like
on mobile on a big

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.976
screen on all that
type of stuff your

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.976
website should still
operate more or

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.976
less the same and still
be accessible to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.001
everyone

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.533
so there are 12 general
guidelines for

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.976
implementing these
principles which have

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.667
61 testable criteria
and there are three

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.976
levels of conformance
a double-a and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.976
triple-a so at this point you're

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.976
probably like feel
a little bit like

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.667
Cody here because yeah
it's very complex

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.976
and in making a
site completely web

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.976
accessible and
implementing it as Triple

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.976
A which is the highest
level is very

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.533
difficult and it takes
a long time the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.976
point is you shouldn't
worry about that

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.976
too much

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.976
you should mostly
focus on when you're

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.976
building a website
think about the type

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.976
of things that could
make life easier

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.976
for disabled people think about

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.976
implementing alternatives
so if you have

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.976
a function that
really just can't be

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.976
implemented in a way
that's accessible

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.976
provide an alternative
to get the same

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.976
information it doesn't
have to be on the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.976
main site as long as
you can get to it

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.400
from the main site
and even a lot of

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.976
like professional
websites and even a

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.976
lot of governments
only require single A

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.976
or double-a levels of
conformance Triple

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.667
A is very very much
an ideal moreso than

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.600
a practical thing for
large websites so

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.976
to think about what
kind of disabilities

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.976
you should be targeting
here are some

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.600
general categories
you have people with

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.976
visual disabilities
for example the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.976
blind

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.976
colorblind things like
that people can't

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.400
read very well so
for these types of

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.976
things you need to
think about how you

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.467
use color a lot you
shouldn't use you

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.976
shouldn't have contrast
between text and

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.976
background that makes
it difficult to

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.976
see you should
make sure all your

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.976
websites are capable
of being used by

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.976
screen readers which
are basically just

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.976
things that are operated
by the keyboard

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.976
and just read out
the content of the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.533
thing so for example
a classic example

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.667
of this is an image
tag you need to have

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.200
an alt tag in your
images because

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.976
otherwise people with
slow internet or

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.976
people using screen
readers are not

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.976
going to get anything
information from

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.976
that it's just going
to be this mystical

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.976
thing that no one can
look at you have

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.976
people of audio
disabilities so for

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.600
example deafness
hard-of-hearing and so

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.867
these are the aforementioned

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.976
transcripts come in
a lot of handy you

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.976
want to have
subtitles for videos

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.267
transcripts for
podcasts etc motor

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.976
disabilities so for
example things that

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.976
make it difficult to
use a mouse or even

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.976
things that make it
difficult to use a

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.976
keyboard this is why
you want to have

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.976
your website be
completely accessible

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.976
solely from the
keyboard so that people

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.600
not who can't use a
mouse can still use

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.467
it completely and
then cognitive this

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.976
one's a little bit
harder to quantify

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.400
specifically but
basically just make

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.976
your information able
to be accessed by

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.467
people with learning
disabilities you

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.976
know even like younger
children also

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.976
like people who aren't
necessarily going

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.976
to be able to like
read and understand

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.667
like a long block of
text or whatever so

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.976
we're going to go
over another example

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.467
I've built my own
private website and

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.976
I'm really proud of
it so you know I'm

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.976
going to show it to
you guys are you

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.400
ready oh well that
doesn't look very

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.400
good huh all right
so I thought this

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.976
website was gonna be
great but clearly

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.976
there's a lot of
web accessibility

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.976
issues like the
contrast is terrible

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.976
this might trigger
people with epilepsy

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.400
I don't even know
what this is let's

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.976
look at the actual
document so you

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.467
wouldn't clean some
of this up so the

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.976
first thing you
should do when you're

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.976
mixing a website to
make it more web

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.533
accessible is the
biggest problem with

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.976
this code is it's
really hard to read

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.976
because I didn't
implement a stylesheet

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.976
I just have all this
code inside style

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.600
tag I have some inline
styling and then

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.976
my script tag instead
of putting it in a

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.976
separate JavaScript
pile I just put

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.976
actual script right
here so the first

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.976
thing you should do
is refactor those

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.976
and take all those
out and move them to

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.976
a separate file
so the difference

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.976
between this which is this long

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.600
unreadable thing and
then this which is

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.976
just the HTML itself
is huge and it

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.976
makes it much easier
to change things

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.976
it's like for example
you'll notice I've

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.976
been pointed everything
with classes I

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.600
have a script file I
have a style sheet

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.533
somewhere else don't
panic also it's a

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.976
very daunting task
especially when

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.976
you're using some
sort of editor that

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.976
will give you all
these errors for like

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.976
this is not accessible
this is not

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.976
accessible this is
you're doing this

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.976
wrong don't panic
don't worry about

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.976
making everything
perfect immediately

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.976
because it's not going
to be it's very

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.976
difficult to make a
website completely

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.976
web accessible that's
why it's taken so

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.533
long for the w3c to
implement the WCAG

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.976
separate your HTML
from your CSS and

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.533
your JavaScript and
consider providing

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.976
alternatives sometimes
it's a lot easier

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.976
instead of just
completely changing your

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.976
main site to just
provide a link there

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.976
that says you know
for people with this

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.976
disability consider
using this other

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.976
resource and then you
can just provide

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.976
it very simply without
having to change

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.600
your main website and
then if anyone is

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.533
interested you can
read about the WCAG

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.333
guidelines in greedy
detail at this

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.133
website thank you

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
